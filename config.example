# mode: How to handle IP updates
#   swap        - Only replaces YOUR old IP with the new IP
#                 Other IPs in the rule are preserved
#                 Use this for shared firewalls where others have static IPs
#
#   replace_all - Replaces ALL IPs on the specified ports with your new IP
#                 Use this for personal/dev firewalls where only you need access
#
# ports: Comma-separated list of ports to update (no spaces)
#        Examples: "22" or "22,80,443"
#
# Examples:
#
# Production server - only update port 22, preserve other admin IPs:
# FIREWALLS="abc12345-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678:swap:22"
#
# Dev server - update ports 22, 80, 443, replace all IPs:
# FIREWALLS="def67890-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678:replace_all:22,80,443"
#
# Multiple firewalls:
# FIREWALLS="abc12345-...:swap:22 def67890-...:replace_all:22,80,443"
